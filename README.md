## Overview

- Complete the form only using their keyboard
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Tailwind CSS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [TypeScript] (https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [Formik](https://formik.org/) - For the form creation
- [Yup] (https://github.com/jquense/yup) - For the form validation
- [React Number format] (https://s-yadav.github.io/react-number-format/) - For the currency formatting
- 


### What I learned

I learned how to handle the asynchronous update of state in React, how to work with forms and customise the deafault style for inputs, error messages, etc.

I also learned how to use TypeScript interfaces for the maximum type safety.
